# Section 19 Section Challenge 1

## Formatting output

The starter source code for this project has been provided.\
In this challenge, you are to display the provided data in a nicely formatted
table.\
Your table does not have to match mind, but practice with the format
manipulators so you become comfortable with them.

There are 3 structurs provided. Yes, these coud also be classes with public
data, but it's common to use structures when we simply want to model only data
and not operations as we would with classes.

The structures work toegether to create a Tours structure that will contain
information about Tours to South America.\
The Tours include Countries, Cities within those countries, along with
population and cost data for each city tour.\
I know, population? Huh? I just wanted a big number so that you can format it,
okay? :)

In the provided source code, I am giving you some code that displays the data
from the structures and the vectors within the structures. This code uses tabs
to format the data, and it makes it look pretty ugly.

Have fun!! Create functions if you like, use constants, whatever you think makes
sense!
